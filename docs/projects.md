### Amazon Redshift

The first project I worked on at Amazon Redshift was the "Compiler Upgrade" of Redshift Data Plane.

I also worked on the development and testing for Cross-instance Restores to restore Redshift snapshots to clusters that have different sizes and/or different node types. For more details: [announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/amazon-redshift-launches-cross-instance-restore/).
